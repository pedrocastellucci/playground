The objective is to fill a 9\u00d79 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3\u00d73 sub-grids that compose the grid (also called \"boxes\", \"blocks\", \"regions\", or \"sub-squares\") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a unique solution.</i>\n",
